# Pizza Shop Website

## Description
I created this website to practice and improve my knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This is a fictional pizza shop, but I took inspiration from various local pizzerias in my town.

The project showcases a simple and visually appealing interface that includes common features found in pizza shop websites, such as menus, contact information, and promotional sections.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Features like clickable menus and a form for placing orders or contacting the shop.
- **Custom Animations:** Subtle animations and transitions enhance the user experience.
- **Fictional Menu:** A variety of pizza options with fun names and descriptions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the website.
- **CSS** for styling and layout, including the use of flexbox and grid.
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements, such as dynamic menus or form validation.

## What I Learned
- Structuring a multi-page website with reusable components.
- Using **media queries** to make a site responsive.
- Adding interactive elements with vanilla JavaScript.
- Writing clean and maintainable code for both HTML and CSS.
